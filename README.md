ShaderSketches
--------------

This is a repository that stores GLSL shader sketches I created while commuting
every day. You can see GIFs of these sketches from [here][Tumblr].

I'm using [KodeLife][KodeLife] shader editor and [GPD Win] handhel PC for
sketching. In my opinion, this is the best environment for portable development.
I created all these sketches while standing in a train.

Note that the coding convention of KodeLife is a bit different from [ShaderToy]
[ShaderToy] or [GLSL Sandbox][GLSLSandbox]. You have to modify the code to run
them on these environments.
